# ChargedUp

This github repo includes python notebooks, website files, and datasets related to ChargedUp project predicting Electric Vehicle Charging station availability. This work was completed during the summer of 2022 during Berkeley's ischool MIDS program. 

Exponential growth in electric vehicles (EVs) will put more pressure on public EV charging station availability, especially as EV adoption becomes more economical and equitable. Concern about charging infrastructure is a commonly cited factor inhibiting EV adoption, particularly for lower income households or individuals living in multi-unit dwellings, who may rely more heavily on public charging.
Our solution to this problem is to provide insights on charging station availability, giving EV drivers the best times to charge and giving potential EV adopters reassurance that public charging stations are accessible.
We mimicked streaming data to simulate real-time information coming from active EV charging stations. We successfully implemented long short-term memory neural network models across multiple cities, with over 27 charging stations and developed interactive tools to view the results.
